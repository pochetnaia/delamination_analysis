# Delamination Rate Analysis in Drosophila Dorsal thorax (notum) development

This repository contains code, datasets, and results associated with an M1 Internship conducted at the Bellaiche Lab under the supervision of Adrien Leroy, Floris Bosveld and Yohanns Bellaiche. 

The primary focus of repository is to provide tools to measure microchaete divisions timings using Fiji Macro and analyze delamination rate in the developing notum.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into three main directories:

data: This directory contains the CSV files with the quantified divisions and delamination rates used in the analysis.
notebooks: This directory contains Python notebooks and ImageJ scripts for data analysis and visualization.
results: This directory contains figures and results generated from the analysis notebooks.

This project was conducted as part of an M1 Internship at the Belliache Lab, under the supervision of:

Adrien Leroy
Floris Bosveld
Yohanns Bellaïche

# Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the Bellaïche Lab for their support and guidance throughout the project.
