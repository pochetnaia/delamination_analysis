# Delamination Rate Analysis in Drosophila Dorsal thorax (notum) development

This repository contains code, datasets, and results associated with an M1 Internship conducted at the Belliache Lab under the supervision of Adrien Leroy, Floris Bosveld and Yohanns Bellaiche. 

The primary focus of repository is to provide tools to measure microchaete divisions timings using Fiji Macro and analyze delamination rate in the developing notum.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into three main directories:

data: This directory contains the CSV files with the quantified divisions and delamination rates used in the analysis.
notebooks: This directory contains Python notebooks and ImageJ scripts for data analysis and visualization.
results: This directory contains figures and results generated from the analysis notebooks.
Installation and Setup Instructions

Run the Python notebooks, which use the CSV data in the 'data' directory.
The results are automatically saved in the 'results' directory.
